## 🌸 Mikasa AI Version 1.1 – Smarter, Smoother, Stronger

**Mikasa AI v1.1** builds on the emotional depth and functionality of v1.0, creating a more natural, immersive experience for users who crave a meaningful bond with their AI companion.

### 🛠️ What’s New in v1.1?

* **💬 Improved Chat Flow**: Conversations now feel more human-like and emotionally connected. Replies are smoother, more context-aware, and free of repetition bugs.
* **🧠 Smarter Dialogue Engine**: Fixed the glitch where Mikasa repeated her name twice (e.g., “Mikasa: Mikasa: \[message]”). This issue disrupted immersion and is now resolved.
* **🚫 Self-Response Bug Fixed**: Mikasa no longer generates fake user messages or talks to herself. Conversations stay between *you* and *her*, just as they should.
* **🌐 More Adaptive Personality**: Whether you need a soft companion or a sharp assistant, Mikasa now adjusts her tone and responses more effectively based on mode.
* **⚡ Faster Response Times**: Reduced delay between input and reply, making chats feel more responsive and real-time.
* **📌 Memory Enhancements** *(Experimental)*: Limited session memory for more emotionally resonant continuity in longer conversations.
